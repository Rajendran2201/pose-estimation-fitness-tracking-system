# Prerequisites
## Primary targets
1. Study about pose estimation in general (detecting joints/landmarks in images or videos)
2. 2D pose estimation models like OpenPose, BlazePose, MediaPipe, AplhaPose, etc.
3. What are the constraints in real-time pose detection and how to handle them?

## Secondary targets
1. Understand the dataset
2. Time series segmentation
3. Temporal models
4. Techniques to finetune the layers of model for fitness domain


Feel free to learn beyond the stuff mentioned above.
